      <h1>BEST HORROR SCENES</h1>
      <p>
        An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in horror.
        “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
        most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
        may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
        necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror, and all
        have the same general effect: unease, dread, fear, shock, disgust.

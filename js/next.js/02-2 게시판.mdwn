# Dynamic Routing example

This example shows how to do [dynamic routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) in Next.js. It contains two dynamic routes:

1. `pages/post/[id]/index.js`
   - e.g. matches `/post/my-example` (`/post/:id`)
1. `pages/post/[id]/[comment].js`
   - e.g. matches `/post/my-example/a-comment` (`/post/:id/:comment`)

These routes are automatically matched by the server.
You can use `next/link` as displayed in this example to route to these pages client side.
